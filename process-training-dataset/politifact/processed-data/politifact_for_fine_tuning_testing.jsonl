Both drugs are Food and Drug Administration-approved for certain uses and are for sale in the U.S.\u00a0Doctors also have the authority to prescribe the drugs off label for uses other than the ones for which they are approved. That typically happens when there are no effective treatment options for a condition, such as in the early days of the pandemic before vaccines and antiviral treatments were widely available.The FDA in March 2020 first granted emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate as COVID-19 treatments during former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\u00a0Hydroxychloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used to treat diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. It soared in popularity in March 2020, before it received the FDA\u2019s emergency use authority, after Trump touted the drug as a COVID-19 treatment.The agency rescinded its authorization three months later after data showed hydroxychloroquine wasn\u2019t effective in treating COVID-19 and the drug presented risk of adverse cardiac events.The FDA has never authorized ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment. In humans, ivermectin is used in tablet form to treat parasites and in topical form to treat lice and some skin conditions. There is also an animal version used to treat heartworm disease and parasites.After some people grew interested in using the drug as a COVID-19 treatment, the FDA in 2021, under President Joe Biden, warned that studies showed the drug wasn\u2019t effective in treating or preventing COVID-19. The warning came amid reports it received that people were self-medicating with the animal version, which is unsafe for humans.The FDA, however, said in a court hearing in a lawsuit accusing it of interfering with doctors\u2019 judgment in treating COVID-19 patients that doctors do have the authority to prescribe ivermectin to treat COVID-19.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows an increase in the amount of fentanyl seized by border authorities since Biden took office. About 27 thousands pounds of fentanyl was seized in fiscal year 2023 and more than 7,000 pounds have been seized so far this fiscal year (October through January). Experts told PolitiFact that a rise in drug seizures could signal that more drugs are flowing into the country.In his 2023 State of the Union speech, Biden called for a \"major surge\" to stop fentanyl production and trafficking, with more drug detection machines at the border and stronger penalties for trafficking.Biden's proposed fiscal year 2024 budget calls for spending $535 million in U.S. Customs and Border Protection for technology, including $305 million for \"non-intrusive inspection systems\" with a primary focus on detecting fentanyl at ports of entry, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a March 2023 statement.Here are some other moves the Biden administration has taken in response to the fentanyl crisis:In March 2022, at the administration's request, the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs voted to control three chemicals used to produce illicit fentanyl.In July, the White House launched the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats, an effort with more than 80 countries to coordinate approaches to battle the issue.In August, Biden announced $450 million in new funding to tackle drug abuse and trafficking.In October, Biden issued a $1.2 billion supplemental funding request to Congress to help stop fentanyl\u2019s flow into the country at the southern border by providing funding for more border patrol agents, law enforcement officers and \"cutting-edge inspection machines.\" That money has been tied up in Congress for months after Republicans rejected a bipartisan deal that would have provided border money, along with as money for Israel and Ukraine.In November, Biden announced the resumption of bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics with China, a large source of the precursor chemicals Mexican cartels use to produce illicit fentanyl.In December, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced a Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force aimed at cracking down on illicit financial networks that support drug cartels and traffickers.Our rulingAn Instagram post\u2019s claim that the government has done more to stop ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine distribution than to fentanyl\u2019s flow into the U.S. is wrong.

We found no worldwide gun violence ranking with that number of countries.The claim is similar to a meme that has been circulating since at least 2015 that we rated Pants on Fire!\u00a0Subtracting the total number of firearm homicides across the five cities mentioned would reduce the 2022 U.S. gun homicide rate from 5.0 deaths per 100,000 people to 4.5 per 100,000. That means it wouldn\u2019t reduce the rate enough for the U.S. to be on the lowest end of a global gun violence ranking.PolitiFact contacted Callen for comment but did not hear back.Where the U.S. ranks for firearm homicides\u00a0There are many ways to measure gun violence rates across countries, so the U.S. ranking varies. Most criminologists use the number of shootings-per-100,000-people metric to account for differences in population size.The 2019 Global Burden Disease study includes the most recent and complete worldwide data on gun violence rates, and the number of countries and territories it includes is most similar to the number in Callen\u2019s claim. In the study of 204 countries and territories, the U.S. ranked third for overall number of deaths caused by physical violence by firearm, behind Brazil and Mexico.

Three years later, in 2022, when the COVID-19 pandemic had driven up violent crimes, including homicides, the FBI reported that the U.S. gun homicide rate was 5.0 deaths per 100,000.\u00a0If subtracting gun homicides in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and St. Louis from the 2022 data, the U.S. gun homicide rate would decrease to 4.5 deaths per 100,000 people.\u00a0Gun homicide data for 2022 for all countries is not yet available. But based on 2022 data about 43 countries collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \u2014 which did not include the U.S. \u2014\u00a0 a U.S. gun homicide rate of 4.5 per 100,000 people would put the country in 13th\u00a0place, higher than 31\u00a0other countries, if it were included. That means the U.S. would not rank at the very bottom of a global list, as the Instagram post claims.\u00a0Another dataset supports that conclusion. A 2021 report by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluations said the U.S. ranked seventh out of 65 high-income countries and territories for the rate of firearm homicides per 100,000 people.By comparison, other high-income countries have extremely low gun homicide rates per 100,000 people, including Singapore (0.01), Korea (0.02) and the United Kingdom (0.04). The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluations report shows that all but 14 of the 65 high-income countries have firearm homicide rates lower than 1.0.\"Plenty of researchers have parsed the data and concluded that the U.S. homicide rate is a gross outlier among high-income countries and even much poorer countries and this shows up overwhelmingly in firearm homicide rates,\" Daniel Webster, distinguished research scholar for the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, wrote in an email to PolitiFact.Even among datasets from the same year, there are differences. The 2019 Global Burden of Disease study estimated 13,001 deaths in the U.S. from physical violence by firearm, and the FBI reported 10,258 firearm homicides the same year. The FBI figures come from crime data voluntarily reported by participating law enforcement agencies nationwide, and the Global Burden of Disease figures come from more than 280,000 data sources including hospitals, governments, surveys and other worldwide databases.\u00a0Subtracting the five cities from the dataEverytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, analyzed the FBI\u2019s 2022 gun violence data and found that 20 cities, including the five mentioned in the Instagram post, accounted for 50% of U.S. gun homicides.\u00a0The FBI reported 16,800 fatal gun homicides in the U.S. in 2022, which translates to a national rate of 5.0 deaths per 100,000 people.\u00a0\nFeatured Fact-check\n\nFacebook posts\n\nstated on February 4, 2024 in una publicaci\u00f3n en Facebook\n\n\"Texas dar\u00e1 a los Latinos un est\u00edmulo de salud de hasta $6,400\" que \u201ccubrir\u00e1 tus alimentos y el alquiler por un a\u00f1o\u201d.\n\nBy Maria Brice\u00f1o \u2022 February 12, 2024\nThe number of firearm homicides in those five cities totaled 1,816 in 2022.

If their vaccine was approved by the FDA, then they can give blood without a waiting period. If they can\u2019t remember the name of the manufacturer, they must wait two weeks from their vaccination before they can give blood.FDA guidance was updated in 2022 to say that COVID-19 vaccine recipients do not need a waiting period for blood donation unless they received a live-attenuated viral COVID-19 vaccine, in which case they should wait two weeks.Live-attenuated vaccines are distinct because they contain a weakened form of the germ that can cause an infection. They are included in some bacterial and viral vaccines to provide immunity against future infection. The Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies, a non-profit representing blood collectors and other institutions involved in transfusion medicine, says wait periods are recommended because it is possible that blood donors who have received live-attenuated vaccines can pass the virus to others through blood donations.Carly Pflaum, an FDA spokesperson, told PolitiFact via email that no live-attenuated viral COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for use in the U.S., and all FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines are nonreplicating, inactivated or mRNA based.However, a live-attenuated COVID-19 vaccine is under development in the clinical trial stage.

{"prompt": "Please do fact checking for CLAIM '\u201cMarijuana is currently classified in the same category of drugs as heroin and a more dangerous category than fentanyl or cocaine.\u201d' with CONTEXT 'When Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., shared a newsletter with constituents recently, she made the first item of business federal marijuana policy.In the Feb. 3 newsletter, Gillibrand wrote that \"marijuana is currently classified in the same category of drugs as heroin and a more dangerous category than fentanyl or cocaine.\"Gillibrand is correct about marijuana\u2019s federal status. That decades-old classification clashes with the drug\u2019s widespread state-level legalization in recent years.Four states fully outlaw marijuana for medical or recreational use: Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina and Wyoming. Seven more states allow the marijuana derivative CBD but not marijuana itself.By contrast, every other state has fully legalized marijuana for recreational and/or medical use or removed criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of the drug.So, why does the federal government still consider marijuana to \"have no medical use\" and believe it has \"the highest potential for disorder and abuse\"?Marijuana as a Schedule I drugThe federal government\u2019s schedule system stems from the Controlled Substances Act, which was enacted in 1970. The schedules run from 1 (for drugs that have the most serious risk of abuse) down to 5 (which are the least likely to be misused).Gillibrand is correct that cocaine and fentanyl both fall within Schedule 2, which covers drugs \"considered dangerous\" and have \"a high potential for abuse.\" Under federal scheduling, the legitimate medical use for cocaine is that it can be used during certain eye surgeries under controlled dosages.Heroin, meanwhile, is considered a Schedule 1 drug, along with marijuana. Other Schedule 1 drugs include LSD and ecstasy.Although states have increasingly passed laws to legalize marijuana for medical and recreational use, fatal poisonings from fentanyl have skyrocketed, particularly from contamination within other dangerous drugs.PolitiFact recently rated True the statement that the United States has seen \"more Americans die of fentanyl than the Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam wars, combined.\"Still, marijuana is more potent than it used to be, with the highest concentrations of THC, the main psychoactive ingredient, found in concentrated cannabis products. Marijuana potency has increased from 4% THC in 1995 to 17% in 2017, and at one dispensary in California, a strain of cannabis that could be smoked had 41% THC, according to KFF Health News.\u00a0What does Gillibrand support?Gillibrand\u2019s office told PolitiFact she supports a full descheduling of marijuana but would also consider a rescheduling to a lower level as an alternative.\nFeatured Fact-check\n\nInstagram posts\n\nstated on February 26, 2024 in an Instagram post\n\nThe government did more to stop the distribution of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine than to stop the distribution of fentanyl.\n\nBy Jeff Cercone \u2022 February 29, 2024\nGillibrand was one of eight co-sponsors of the Marijuana Justice Act, which several Democratic senators introduced in the 2019-20 congressional session. The bill would have removed marijuana from the list of controlled substances. Her office added that moving marijuana away from Schedule 1 would enable more research, because Schedule 1 drugs are subject to greater restrictions on medical and scientific study.\u00a0Gillibrand also argues that changing marijuana\u2019s status would help ease operations for marijuana-based businesses and unclog court dockets.What is the outlook for federal rescheduling or descheduling?Mason Tvert, a marijuana policy specialist with\u00a0VSStrategies, a Denver-based cannabis consulting company, said\u00a0the federal government has already taken limited steps toward rescheduling marijuana.In August 2023, the federal Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the Drug Enforcement Administration reschedule cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3, though the recommendation\u2019s full text was not released. In January, the department released a 252-page, unredacted copy of the text in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.\u00a0Schedule 3 would put marijuana on par with some dosages of codeine, as well as ketamine, anabolic steroids and testosterone.This marked the first time in history that any federal agency had publicly acknowledged cannabis as having an accepted medical use and relatively low potential for abuse.Even so, Jonathan Caulkins, who studies drug policy at Carnegie Mellon University, told PolitiFact he doesn\u2019t expect rescheduling to happen soon.If marijuana were to be rescheduled, then every distributor would have to be licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Caulkins said. This would be a challenge, he said, given variations in the strains of marijuana and the lack of a \"baseline\" version under the law.Tvert acknowledged that rescheduling might drag further because of this.\u00a0If DEA agreed with the recommendation, the agency would have to publish a proposed rule to reschedule cannabis. That would start a rulemaking process with as much as a 60-day public comment period.A bigger bottleneck, he said, would come in the courts, as people request administrative hearings; clearing these could take months. All told, rescheduling could take a year or longer, and if President Joe Biden loses reelection, his successor could shelve the process.Our rulingGillibrand said, \"Marijuana is currently classified in the same category of drugs as heroin and a more dangerous category than fentanyl or cocaine.\"Gillibrand is correct that the federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, which means it is considered a greater concern than either fentanyl or cocaine, which are classified as Schedule 2 drugs.Now that most states have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use, federal officials are considering rescheduling marijuana to a lower category of concern.

Navalny, who died Feb. 16 in a Russian prison.In a Feb. 20 Fox News town hall, host Laura Ingraham asked how Trump will put up the money for the almost half-billion-dollar fine.\u00a0\"It is a form of Navalny, it is a form of communism or fascism,\" Trump replied.\u00a0\u00a0Earlier in the show, Trump also called Navalny\u2019s death a \"very sad situation\" and described him as \"brave.\" Then he pivoted to his legal cases, describing himself as a similar target of political persecution.\"It's a horrible thing. It's happening in our country, too,\" said Trump. \"I'm the leading candidate. I never heard of being indicted before. I got indicted four times. I have eight or nine trials. All because of the fact that I\u2019m \u2014 and you know, this all because of the fact that I'm in politics.\"Trump made similar comments days earlier, on his Truth Social platform, comparing his legal woes with what happened to Navalny and likening President Joe Biden to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\"The sudden death of Alexei Navalny has made me more and more aware of what is happening in our Country,\" he said on Truth Social Feb. 19, describing \"unfair courtroom decisions.\"\u00a0\u00a0A few other Republicans have made similar points, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former U.S. Rep.Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., and conservative activist Dinesh D\u2019Souza.We considered not rating Trump\u2019s statement comparing his civil case with Navalny\u2019s situation; we recognize that in speechmaking and political rhetoric, there is license for hyperbole.\u00a0But after examining the foundation of Trump\u2019s comparison between his legal troubles and the prosecution of a Putin dissident under an authoritarian regime, and after speaking to six experts in Russian history, politics and the U.S. legal system, we determined there were enough factual elements at play to rate his statement on the Truth-O-Meter.We emailed Trump\u2019s spokespeople to ask for his evidence and got no reply by our deadline.The evidence comes down to this: Navalny led protests against an authoritarian regime and returned to his country knowing he was a target and landed in prison. Trump was found by a judge to have inflated his real estate assets and has the legal right to appeal.\"If Biden\u2019s staff oversaw an effort to poison Trump on a campaign trip, and then when he recovered arranged for him to be sent to a prison camp in northern Alaska, and then when he died told (his wife) Melania she would be arrested if she tried to enter the U.S., his complaint might be more convincing,\" said Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.Navalny lacked due process protections afforded to TrumpRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny stands in a cage Feb. 20, 2021, in the Babuskinsky District Court in Moscow. (AP)Navalny, 47, was an attorney, an anti-corruption activist and a critic of Putin\u2019s. In 2011, he led thousands of Russians in protesting falsified elections. In 2017, he was barred from running for president after a Russian court convicted him of fraud, charges that were condemned by the European Union, European Parliament and Amnesty International.In 2020, while flying, Navalny became ill and was taken to Germany for treatment; the German government said he was poisoned by a chemical weapon developed by the Soviet Union. Months after he was poisoned, he flew back to Russia, where he was arrested and was sentenced to two years in prison after authorities said he repeatedly violated parole. Amnesty International designated him a \"prisoner of conscience,\" stating \"has not been imprisoned for any recognizable crime, but for demanding the right to equal participation in public life for himself and his supporters, and for demanding a government that is free from corruption.\"In 2023, Navalny was sentenced to 19 years in prison for the charge of \"extremism.\" Human Rights Watch called it \"totally unfounded\" and said that \"the Russian authorities have abandoned any pretense of justice in dealing with dissenters.\"On Feb. 16, Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service said Navalny died. The next day, a spokesperson for him confirmed his death. Observers believe Navalny died as a result of his incarceration although the specific reasons are not yet known.Meanwhile, after a trial, Judge Arthur Engoron ruled Feb. 16 that Trump had inflated the value of many of his real estate assets to \"make more money.\" One example: The judge found that Trump had claimed the Trump Tower penthouse was three times the size.Trump and his companies and others involved in his business empire owe about $450 million including interest. New York Attorney General Letitia James filed the case.Some differences between Trump\u2019s civil case and the cases against Navalny, according to experts we interviewed:\u00a0Trump has not been barred from political office and is running for the U.S. presidency, on track to win the Republican nomination. Navalny was barred from running. Several cases have been filed seeking to remove Trump from the ballot as a result of his actions leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump has had due process to fight those efforts, and the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Feb. 8.Trump has not been poisoned or imprisoned, although he faces charges that carry potential prison time. His penalty in the civil case involves paying money and he is banned from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years.\nFeatured Fact-check\n\nJoe Biden\n\nstated on February 8, 2024 in a speech\n\nOn classified documents in his possession, \u201cnone of it was high classified.\u201d\n\nBy Maria Ramirez Uribe \u2022 February 9, 2024\nTrump has been allowed access to a full legal defense team to challenge the judge\u2019s motions, bring forward expert testimony and file an appeal.The \"extremism\" charge on which Navalny was convicted doesn\u2019t exist in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0Internationally, the U.S. justice system has checks and balances and has rules that require it operate independently from the executive branch. Putin has power and control over Russia\u2019s justice system.Navalny was not afforded the due process protections that Trump has had in the New York fraud case.\"Navalny was repeatedly poisoned and then imprisoned for exposing corruption,\" said Harley Balzer, an expert on Russian and Soviet social history at Georgetown University. \"He had documents, interviews with insiders and photos to prove his allegations. He even had a tape of a conversation with one of the people who ordered one of the poisonings. None of the evidence used in the trials where Navalny was convicted was substantive.\"Navalny in 2020 released the phone call he said he made to a security operative. The man in the recording said he was involved in cleaning up Navalny\u2019s clothes \"so that there wouldn\u2019t be any traces.\"Engoron found that Trump committed fraud. The four criminal cases against Trump remain pending trial: two pertain to election interference, while one relates to his possession of classified documents post-presidency and the other case alleges he paid off a porn star.\"He has remained a free man with the right to full access to counsel, the right to travel across the country and campaign for political office, and has remained protected by his Secret Service detail,\" said Erik Herron, a political scientist specializing in Russia at West Virginia University.\u00a0\"These are rights that were not extended to Navalny.\"The United States has an independent judiciary to rule on the cases and a jury to ensure impartiality whereas Navalny was prosecuted in a country without the rule of law or independent courts, said Ric Simmons, Ohio State University law professor.\"Trump has also stated that the criminal cases against him are politically motivated \u2014 as the case against Navalny was \u2014 but given the procedural protections in this country (which do not exist in Russia), political prosecutions are very rare,\" Simmons said. \"There will be no way of convicting Trump of any of these crimes unless the prosecutors can prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt using admissible evidence that is found to be credible by an impartial jury, regardless of the political motivations of any of the prosecutors.\"University of Chicago political science professor Scott Gehlbach said that given the conditions under which Navalny died, lacking due process and enduring isolation and torture for what he called \"trumped-up charges,\" Trump\u2019s citation of his civil fraud case \"is an insult to Alexei Navalny, to his family, and to the millions of Russians who mourn his passing.\"\u00a0Putin has used the courts to target his critics and arrest political dissidents. Authorities have introduced restrictions on peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. Torture of prisoners is common. In 2022, Navalny was placed in a punishment cell multiple times in degrading conditions for \"violations\" of prison rules, such as \"wearing the wrong clothes,\" according to Amnesty International.\"In a communist or fascist regime the top political leadership tells the judge what verdict it wants,\" Sestanovich said.In the U.S. system, the judges are independent and the proceedings are public, Balzer said.Kathryn Hendley, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told The Wall Street Journal of Russia\u2019s system \"when they really care about something they have no trouble using the law as a blunt instrument,\" she said, forbidding criticism of the war or public gatherings. \"The Russian criminal justice system is incredibly sticky \u2014 once you are in, it's very, very hard to get out.\"Even if Trump\u2019s fraud fine stands, or if he is convicted in any of the criminal cases, his case bears no legal similarities to Navalny\u2019s.\"Trump may end up poorer, or subjected to probation or a short prison sentence \u2014 but he won\u2019t be sent to the Arctic and killed,\" said Mark Osler, University of St. Thomas law professor.Our rulingTrump said the fine in his New York fraud case \"is a form of Navalny, it is a form of communism or fascism.\"Although Trump is embroiled in numerous legal battles, his civil case involved a fine, not imprisonment, not poisoning, not subjugation to a legal system dominated by an authoritarian regime.Trump is free to express outrage about the fine and a New York judge\u2019s ruling against him. He is free to speak against the government. He is free to hire lawyers. He is free to appeal his cases. He is free to travel the country while he campaigns for president.Navalny was blocked from running for public office. He was poisoned by a chemical weapon that the German government said was developed by the Soviet Union. He was convicted in Russia and sentenced to prison largely on the charge of \"extremism\" which does not exist in the United States. Numerous human rights organizations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the cases against Navalny were unjust and that Russia was crushing dissent. Navalny died in prison under conditions that have not been fully explained.Trump has been given due process in the fraud case and has the legal right to appeal.

Second, foot-and-mouth disease has not been detected in the U.S. since 1929.(Instagram screenshot)There have not been 17 million people \"let in\" to the U.S. in recent years. Since February 2021, Biden\u2019s first full month in office, there have been about 8.8 million nationwide encounters with migrants at U.S. borders, data through January 2024 shows.

There have been more than 3.7 million expulsions, removals and returns under Biden, the data shows.The claim that foot-and-mouth disease is back as a result of migrants entering the U.S is inaccurate, said Lyndsay Cole, a spokesperson for the U.S. Agriculture Department\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\"There are not currently any cases of foot-and-mouth disease in livestock in the United States,\u2019\"\u00a0Cole told PolitiFact.Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious viral disease that affects livestock, such as cows, sheep, pigs and other animals with divided hoofs, according to the inspection service.\nFeatured Fact-check\n\nFacebook posts\n\nstated on February 19, 2024 in a Facebook post\n\nPhoto shows Minnesota Sen.

They are completely different viruses.\u00a0Hand, foot and mouth disease is common in children younger than 5 years old, although anyone can get it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s contagious and causes sores and rashes, but it\u2019s usually not serious, the CDC said.Hand, foot and mouth disease usually spreads in the late summer and fall. It\u2019s already common here, Forthal said.\u00a0\"Anybody traveling with the infection could spread it,\" Forthal said. \"Since it\u2019s a common infection here and elsewhere, migration from outside of the U.S. is not at all necessary for spread.\"An Instagram post\u2019s claim that 17 million immigrants let into the U.S. has resulted in the reemergence of foot-and-mouth disease in the country is wrong.

Cloud seeding works by releasing silver iodide particles into the clouds during storms to increase precipitation.But the Instagram post misleads both about the cloud seeding program\u2019s\u00a0 connection to recent storms and silver iodide\u2019s safety.A storm fueled by an atmospheric river \u2014 narrow corridors packed with water vapor that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calls \"rivers in the sky\" \u2014 dumped buckets of rain, heavy winds and snow across California for three days beginning Feb. 18. In early February, similar back-to-back storms pummeled California, the second of which triggered hundreds of landslides in Los Angeles and killed at least nine people.However, no cloud seeding took place during the two most recent severe storms, said Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority spokesperson Melissa Bustamonte.\"Cloud seeding was not performed during the Feb 3-8 storm events. These storm events were determined to be either too large or too close in succession to cloud seed,\" Bustamonte said. \"Also, the storm event of Feb 18-19 was not seeded either.\"The authority\u2019s website lists the dates and areas where cloud seeding took place. The last cloud seeding happened Feb. 1, the website shows. Southern California that day was drenched by a storm dubbed a \"Pineapple Express\" \u2014 meaning an atmospheric river originating from Hawaii.\nFeatured Fact-check\n\nFacebook posts\n\nstated on February 19, 2024 in a Facebook post\n\nPhoto shows Minnesota Sen.

She pointed to massive weather systems that have associated atmospheric rivers.\"No attempts at cloud seeding in some mountain region would cause such widespread precipitation as we are witnessing all over California,\" Magnusdottir said.Adele Igel, an associate professor in the University of California, Davis\u2019 Department of Land, Air and Water Resources, said cloud seeding does not change general weather patterns.She said estimates from the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority feasibility study show that ground-based seeding could increase precipitation by up to 4.5%.\"This means that if an area would have received one inch of precipitation without seeding, it would instead receive 1.045 inches with cloud seeding,\" Igel said. \"The cloud seeding then is not the determining factor for heavy rain.\"Igel also said the silver iodide used in the cloud seeding \"is harmless to the environment.\"A pilot program fact sheet said more than 50 years of research has shown no \"measurable human or environmental effects resulting from the use of silver iodide.\" The concentration of silver iodide in water or snow from a seeded cloud \"is nearly 1,000 times less than the Environmental Protection Agency standards,\" the fact sheet said.Our rulingAn Instagram post connected recent California storms and flooding to a pilot cloud seeding program underway in the state.But the cloud seeding didn\u2019t take place during the two most recent storms, and experts said it couldn\u2019t cause the storms and heavy rainfall seen across the state.

Two of the paper\u2019s authors, Steve Kirsch and Peter McCullough, have often spread misinformation related to COVID-19 and the vaccine.Experts on infectious diseases and vaccines told PolitiFact that the paper\u2019s conclusion is based on misleading and false information about the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The paper repeats multiple claims that PolitiFact and other fact-checkers have debunked.The paper \"stands in contrast\" to the global public health community\u2019s consensus that the mRNA vaccines are safe and effective, said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases professor.\"And so, you have to ask why (the paper) is such an outlier,\" said Schaffner, who is also a spokesperson for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \"The reason it\u2019s an outlier is \u2026 it\u2019s a deeply flawed study.\"Paper\u2019s claims about deathsThe peer-reviewed research paper was published on Cureus, which Schaffner called \"an obscure journal\" that he\u2019d never heard of in his 40 years of public health research. A 2022 Emory University study described Cureus as a \"predatory\" and \"controversial\" journal.The paper claimed the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine saved two lives and caused 27 deaths per 100,000 vaccinations. It said the Moderna vaccine saved 3.9 lives and caused 10.8 deaths per 100,000 vaccinations.The paper\u2019s authors based this conclusion on data from the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in the United States\u00a0and reports of adverse effects from the United Kingdom. Although the datasets came from two different countries, the paper said, \"it is unlikely that the adverse event rates would be different between the two populations.\"The adverse effects reports came from the U.K.\u2019s Yellow Card system, which lets members of the public report suspected safety concerns related to vaccines, medicines and medical devices.This system is similar to the U.S. government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which the paper also cites to suggest the COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe.With VAERS, anyone can report health effects after a vaccination, whether or not those effects are caused by the vaccine, the CDC said. And unlike other government data sources, these reports aren\u2019t screened before they\u2019re made public, making VAERS fertile ground for vaccine misinformation.Paper relies on several debunked claimsThe paper claims the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines did not undergo adequate safety and efficacy testing.This is inaccurate. We have rated multiple claims about this False or Pants on Fire, including\u00a0 that mRNA technology was never tested in humans; that the vaccines were released after only two months of testing in healthy humans; and that a safe vaccine can\u2019t be developed in eight to 10 months.\nFeatured Fact-check\n\nFacebook posts\n\nstated on February 4, 2024 in una publicaci\u00f3n en Facebook\n\n\"Texas dar\u00e1 a los Latinos un est\u00edmulo de salud de hasta $6,400\" que \u201ccubrir\u00e1 tus alimentos y el alquiler por un a\u00f1o\u201d.\n\nBy Maria Brice\u00f1o \u2022 February 12, 2024\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were thoroughly evaluated in clinical trials before receiving emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2020. Since then, public health authorities have continued to closely monitor the vaccines\u2019 safety.\"These vaccines have met rigorous scientific standards for safety and effectiveness. The available data continue to demonstrate that the benefits of these vaccines outweigh their risks,\" said Cherie Duvall-Jones, an FDA spokesperson.Another claim in the paper is mRNA vaccines contain \"DNA contamination.\" We previously fact-checked a similar claim and rated it False.Decades of research has shown that the \"biologically insignificant amounts of DNA\" in the vaccines pose no known safety risk, said Dan Wilson, senior associate scientist at Janssen, which also developed a COVID-19 vaccine. Wilson also hosts \"Debunk the Funk with Dr. Wilson,\" a YouTube show that covers science misinformation.It\u2019s not unusual for vaccines to contain DNA fragments. The measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and rotavirus vaccines also have minuscule amounts of DNA, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and infectious diseases physician at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.The chance that these DNA fragments could integrate into a person\u2019s DNA is \"zero,\" Offit said. \"So, it\u2019s just all a lot of hand-waving.\"The paper also claims the spike proteins produced by COVID-19 vaccination linger in the body and cause adverse effects. PolitiFact has fact-checked several false claims that the spike proteins are harmful or toxic.All coronaviruses, including COVID-19, have spikes known as spike proteins on their surfaces, which the viruses use to bind to cells and cause infection, the CDC said.The mRNA vaccines contain neither the COVID-19 virus nor the spike protein. The vaccines\u2019 mRNA technology gives the body genetic instructions for producing copies of the spike protein, which are harmless. Then, the body breaks down the mRNA and it leaves the body as waste.The spike proteins trigger the body\u2019s immune response, sparking antibody production. This helps the body recognize and fight off the real COVID-19 virus in future infections.Schaffner said the spike protein claim is \"far-fetched\" because there\u2019s no evidence the spike protein produced from the vaccines has caused adverse effects.COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of livesPublic health authorities in the U.S.\u00a0and worldwide have repeatedly found COVID-19 vaccines to be safe and effective.The World Health Organization reported that as of November, more than 13 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had been administered worldwide. In the U.S. alone, more than 676 million doses of the vaccine had been administered as of May.\u00a0In 2021, the first full year the vaccines were widely available, the WHO estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations saved more than 14.4 million lives worldwide.In rare instances, adverse effects, including myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, have been linked to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC said. Myocarditis cases were more common among adolescent and young men within a week of receiving a second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Most patients had mild cases and recovered quickly.Our rulingAn Instagram post claimed a research paper shows that \"mRNA COVID-19 vaccines caused more deaths\" than lives saved.Experts said the paper\u2019s conclusion is based on false and misleading claims. These claims have been repeatedly fact-checked and rated False by PolitiFact and other news outlets.The COVID-19 vaccines have been rigorously tested and monitored for years and public health authorities worldwide continue to find them safe and effective.
