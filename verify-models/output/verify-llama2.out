The claim is FALSE. There is no evidence to support the claim that Bill Gates' investment in lab-grown meat causes "turbo cancers" in humans. The article that made the claim is from a website known for spreading misinformation, and it does not provide any reliable evidence or studies to back up the claim. In fact, scientists who study cultivated meat have said that it is inaccurate to say that immortalized cells used to create lab-grown meat are cancerous. Additionally, there is no evidence that cultured meat cells are going to become cancerous in a diner's body. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.

Answer:  FALSE

Explanation:  The claim that Donald Trump called his wife "Mercedes" instead of Melania is false. During his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump praised his wife Melania and referred to her by name, but he also mentioned Mercedes Schlapp, his former White House strategic communications director and wife of CPAC chair Matt Schlapp, who was sitting in the front row. Trump looked at the audience to his left, where Mercedes was sitting, and said, "Oh look at that, wow. Mercedes, that's pretty good." He referenced Mercedes Schlapp three times during his speech, but did not mistake her for his wife. Therefore, the claim that Trump called his wife "Mercedes" is false.

Answer: FALSE. The claim that 7.2 million illegals entered the U.S. under the Biden administration, and that this is evidence of a planned effort to replace white Americans, is false. The number of encounters with immigrants at the Southwest border does not necessarily represent the number of individuals who entered and remained in the country, as the same person can be recorded multiple times for repeated attempts at crossing the border. Additionally, millions of encounters led to removals, returns, and expulsions, and about 2.3 million people have been released into the U.S. under Biden's administration, mostly families and unaccompanied children. This data does not support the claim of a vast plan to replace white citizens with undocumented immigrants.

  In this fact-checking article, the claim being evaluated is: "Your legal name is in fact a corporation." The article provides evidence to refute this claim, stating that the use of all uppercase letters in government documents, such as birth certificates, has no significance and is done to improve clarity and sorting. Additionally, the article cites the IRS and a U.S. State Department spokesperson to explain that formatting, including capitalization, is used to reduce confusion and increase efficiency in administrative procedures. The article also notes that the straw man conspiracy theory, which the claim is linked to, has been discredited and is unfounded. Therefore, the claim that a person's legal name is a corporation is rated as "Pants on Fire!" which means it is a false and ridiculous claim. The article does not provide any evidence to support the claim, and instead provides evidence to refute it. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.

Answer: FALSE.

Explanation: The claim that NASA was investigating the ocean and stopped doing so to focus on space is false. NASA was created primarily for space exploration, but it has also investigated the ocean since its inception. The agency's mission includes understanding the Earth's system and its effects, and the oceans play a fundamental role in global environmental changes, influencing the world's climate and weather. NASA has continued to investigate the ocean, including launching the PACE mission to study the ocean's role in the Earth's carbon cycle and climate. Therefore, the claim that NASA stopped investigating the ocean is false, and the video on Facebook that made this claim is misleading.

Answer: FALSE

Explanation: 

The claim made by Donald Trump, that his fine in the New York fraud case "is a form of Navalny, it is a form of communism or fascism" is rated as FALSE by PolitiFact. The comparison between Trump's legal troubles and the prosecution of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is found to be inappropriate and factually incorrect.

The article highlights that Trump has not been barred from political office, has access to a full legal defense team, and has the right to appeal, whereas Navalny was barred from running for president, was poisoned, and was sentenced to prison under questionable circumstances. The article also notes that the US justice system has checks and balances, and operates independently from the executive branch, unlike in Russia, where Putin has power and control over the justice system.

Therefore, the claim that Trump's fine is similar to Navalny's situation is baseless, and the comparison is an insult to Alexei Navalny, his family, and the millions of Russians who mourn his passing.

This claim has been flagged by Facebook and Instagram as part of their efforts to combat false news and misinformation. The name "Sahil Omar" has been falsely linked to several other incidents in recent months, including a car crash at a U.S.-Canada border checkpoint, a shooting at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and a hotel explosion in Fort Worth, Texas. There is no evidence to support the claim that a person named Sahil Omar was involved in the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl celebration shooting. Therefore, we rate this claim as FALSE.

I'm happy to help! The answer to whether the claim that a photo shows Taylor Swift wearing an anti-Trump T-shirt is TRUE or FALSE is:
